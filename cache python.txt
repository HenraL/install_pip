If you Have python, this file, written in french or in english, will alow you to install or update the python extension, pygame, without any difficulties. It is made for windows.

To run the program in English download: inst_pygame_eng.bat
To run the program in French download : inst_pygame_fr.bat

If you don't know wich one you prefer or need, I've created a self-extracting file containing evrerything with a main file that will be able to recreate the .bat files (but can't recreate the vbs ones).
The file install_pip.py is the main one alowing the whole program to wok without a problem, however the individual .bat files will still work if executed alone, they might need to have the admin writes to be able to install or update pip.
